# Hermit-AI Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hermit-AI!**

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, **Hermit-AI, Inc.** ("We" or "Us") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Us and our users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

## Agreement

**1. Definitions.**
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Work").

**2. Grant of Copyright License.**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**3. Grant of Patent License.**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

**4. Right to Relicense.**
You acknowledge that We may license the Work (incorporating Your Contribution) under various licenses, including commercial licenses that may not be compatible with open-source licenses. You explicitly grant Us the right to sublicense Your Contribution under any license of Our choice, including proprietary or commercial licenses, without further obligation to You.

**5. Representations.**
You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contribution, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Us, or that Your employer has executed a separate CLA with Us.

**6. No Warranty.**
You provide Your Contribution on a "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
